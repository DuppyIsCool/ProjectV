# ProjectV/S.T.R.E.A.M
This Project is designed to be a multiplayer, cooperative dungeon crawling and town building experience. The game is named STREAM, and for the user to access the game they have to first download the game files and then run the executable file (.exe). Upon opening the executable, the player will be met with a menu screen where they will have the option to host a server and play, connect to a server or host a server without joining it directly.

#Executing the Builds

In order to run the game, open the "ProjectV" executable. Make sure that all of the files in the "Build" folder have been extracted before attempting to run the game. 

From there you will be brought to a menu with 3 buttons, labeled "Host (Server + Client)", "Client", and "Server Only". For the first player, click the "Host (Server + Client)" button, and any additional players should press the "Client button".

Once the game has opened, you can move your character around using the WASD keys (recommended), or the arrow keys. 

Items can be collected by simply walking over them.

You can pull up and close your inventory of items by pressing the E key. Within the inventory, an item can be equipped by double clicking it. 

To use a weapon item, equip it, and click on the screen in the direction you would like to attack. 

To move to different areas of the game, walk into a "portal". These all function the same way, but may look different in different areas of the game (a crystal, a staircase, a doorway, etc.)
